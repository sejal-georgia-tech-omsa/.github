# Georgia Tech OMSA

I am enrolled in the Online M.S. in Analytics program through Georgia Institute of Technology. This is the online space I will use to try and stay organized. All repositories will be kept private for the sake of maintaining academic integrity.

That said, if you are curious, I will document the courses I take throughout my journey here!

- Spring 2023
  - `CSE 6040`: Computing for Data Analysis (Python) [Dr. Richard Vuduc]
  - `ISYE 6051`: Intro to Analytics Modeling (R) [Dr. Joel Sokol]
